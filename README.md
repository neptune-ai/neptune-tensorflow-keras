# Neptune + Keras integration

Experiment tracking, model registry, data versioning, and live model monitoring for Keras trained models.

## What will you get with this integration?

* Log, display, organize, and compare ML experiments in a single place
* Version, store, manage, and query trained models, and model building metadata
* Record and monitor model training, evaluation, or production runs live
* Collaborate with a team

## What will be logged to Neptune?

* hyperparameters for every run,
* learning curves for losses and metrics during training,
* hardware consumption and stdout/stderr output during training,
* TensorFlow tensors as images to see model predictions live,
* training code and Git commit information,
* model weights,
* [other metadata](https://docs.neptune.ai/logging/what_you_can_log)

## Example

On the command line:

```
pip install neptune-tensorflow-keras
```

In Python:

```python
import neptune
from neptune.integrations.tensorflow_keras import NeptuneCallback
from neptune import ANONYMOUS_API_TOKEN

# Start a run
run = neptune.init_run(
    project="common/tf-keras-integration",
    api_token=ANONYMOUS_API_TOKEN,
)

# Create a NeptuneCallback instance
neptune_cbk = NeptuneCallback(run=run, base_namespace="metrics")

# Pass the callback to model.fit()
model.fit(
    x_train,
    y_train,
    epochs=5,
    batch_size=64,
    callbacks=[neptune_cbk],
)

# Stop the run
run.stop()
```
